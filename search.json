    "text": "Summary\n\nI am a technical orientated Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries working in the life insurance industry for 12 years, with 7 years post qualification. I also have experience as an R developer.\n\n\n\nI have a diverse range of actuarial work experience with my main areas of specialty being:\n\nLongevity\nInternal Model Risk Calibration\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nWith Profits Management\n\n\n\n\nI am technically strong and have a breadth of experience developing complex models. I am proficient across a variety of platforms (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\nI have a fantastic track record of performance, both academically and in a work environment (see Figure 2).\n\n\n\nQualifications\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Qualification\n      Awarded By\n      Grade\n      Subject(s)\n      Date\n    \n  \n  \n    Fellowship\nIFoA\nNA\nSA2, ST2, ST6\nDec-2017\n    Bachelors\nUniv. of Cambridge\n1\nNatural Sciences (Chemistry)\nJul-2011\n    Masters\nUniv. of Cambridge\n2.i\nNatural Sciences (Chemistry)\nJul-2011\n    A Level\nNA\nA (x5)\nMaths, Further Maths, ...\nAug-2007\n    GCSE\nNA\nA* (x8); A (x3)\nMaths, English, ...\nAug-2005\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nOther achievements include:\n\nOne of top 5 scores in the UK for GCSE Maths (awarded by AQA in Aug 2005)\nIFoA Certificate in Data Science (awarded by IFoA in Dec 2020)\n\n\n\nSoftware Experience\nThe plot below demonstrates my career experience, both total accumulation and the relative recency. The figures are estimates as at 31/12/2024.\nPlease note the scale is logarithmic.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Summary of Modelling Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\nWhilst employed by Royal London during years 2013 - 2020 I was assigned a performance rating each year, as were all staff. Employees were placed in one of four bands which represent different percentile ranges of performance relative to colleagues. Those bands, and the amount of times I was placed in each band over the 8 year period, are: Improvement Required (0); Good (3); Strong (4) and Exceptional (1). \nBelow I have mapped my historical ratings to a probability density of performance across all percentiles. The density is calculated by the relative frequency of each rating awarded to me, divided over the percentiles of employee performance that rating represents. I have also included the probability density you would expect from an actuary selected randomly from Royal London, for comparison purposes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Performance rating density whilst at Royal London\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nChoosing Paul Beard is a superior strategy to choosing an actuary at random.\n\n\n\n\nWork Experience\n\nSCOR\nEmployed as Contractor (Feb 2024 — Feb 2025)\n\nR Developer for Longevity Pricing (Feb 2024 — Feb 2025)\n\nThe initial project was completed for UK reinsurance pricing of BPA schemes. The project entailed migrating the entire pricing process from Excel / SAS / Word, to a single R workflow. I was the lead developer of an R package and Quarto book that together could perform all pricing calculations required.\nThe migration included building the many complex pricing models in R, some of these include:\n\nPension Value Escalation model\nProportion Married & Proportion Transferred Out derivation models\nExperience Analysis model\nActual vs Expected Analysis and Adjustment model\nNet Present Value Cashflow model\nRisk Based Cashflow (i.e. Stressed Capital Requirement) models\n\nAs well as being able to develop complex actuarial models, the project entailed the following:\n\nHigh quality visualisations including interactivity\nExtensive reconciliation and testing\nDeveloping functions that are flexible, fast and documented via Roxygen\nWorking with Git, Azure and Quarto\nDevelopment of code to interact directly with an API of Club Vita\nConsideration of usability, to develop a template that other actuaries, with less experience in R, could employ\n\nThe initial contract was was for UK business and scheduled over 6 months. The project was completed successfully and to a high standard. The client, pleased with the product, decided to extend the contract for another 6 months to develop similar processes for non-UK business .\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Group\nEmployed as Contractor (Apr 2023 — Feb 2024)\n\nAssumptions Architect for BPAs (April 2023 — Feb 2024)\n\nPhoenix uses MG-Alfa as their main valuation platform. The tables fed into MG-Alfa were created through a set of complex spreadsheets. In this role I developed these spreadsheets in co-ordination with the release cycle.\nWhilst at Phoenix I created a sophisticated comparison tool in R which could compare two complex assumptions spreadsheets. By being able to replicate the tenets of how MG-Alfa reads table structures within R, the tool could produce an intelligent breakdown of assumption table changes which was superior to alternatives being used at the time (e.g. VBA cell-by-cell comparison, BeyondCompare). The tool was packaged and rolled out to other actuaries.\n\n\n\n\nRoyal London\nEmployed as Full-time Employee (Sep 2012 — Apr 2023)\n\nCredit Quality Assessor of Commercial Real Estate Loans (CRELs) (Aug 2021 — Apr 2023)\n\nRoyal London looked to expand the illiquid asset classes it invests in as part of its Matching Adjustment portfolio. This entailed the inclusion of CRELs. In this role I developed an internal credit quality assessment process (ICQA) for CRELs. As this asset class was new to the company, it required a lot of development from ground level.\nAs part of the role I created a complex stochastic model in R which captures the intricate cash flow structure of CRELs. The model simulates defaults across multiple correlated tenants over many time periods, and evaluates the outcomes of the loans to assess the credit quality. \nAfter developing the ICQA process for CRELs, I then developed the internal model risk calibration for CREL risk.\n\n\n\nActuarial Student Overseer (Jun 2018 — Nov 2021)\n\nVolunteered as coordinator and adviser to over 60 students sitting exams at Royal London. This role has required strong communication and leadership skills. I made sure to always be approachable to the students, and keep open paths of dialogue. \n\n\n\nInternal Model Calibrator (Mar 2018 — Aug 2021)\n\nI worked on the development of the company’s Internal Model Application Process (IMAP) and produced calibrations for Longevity, Persistency, Commodity, Property, Mortality/Morbidity risks, as well as Market-to-market Dependencies.\nAnswered questions from both internal validators and the PRA about our IMAP methodology in a short period of time. Resolved validation findings in a timely manner.\nI have led many workshops to co-ordinate the opinions of experts in their respective fields, and form consensus on the assumptions and methodology used in the internal model calibrations.\n\n\n\nWith Profits Management Actuary (Sep 2012 — Mar 2018)\n\nWithin this role I carried out regular analysis on bonus supportability for With Profits business and became a subject matter expert and led a team of actuarial staff to complete year end final bonus reports.\nI was involved in many with profits management tasks including (but not limited to) bonus setting, projections, run-off planning, estate distribution and remediations.\nI have been involved in many bespoke projects, the most material being:\n\nGuaranteed Annuity Option (GAO) compromise scheme pricing\nSurrender value methodology development\nProphet to MG-Alfa model reconciliation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Projects\nI write and publish articles applying actuarial tools to publicly available data. These include:\n\nA mortality investigation of Coronation Street\nAn internal model risk calibration for cryptocurrency risk\nAn analysis of trends in IFoA exam pass rates\n\nThe articles can be found below, along with the R code used to produce the analyses.\nArticles: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-beard-78a420172/recent-activity/posts/ \nCode: https://github.com/paulbeardactuarial"

This can be a problem for any actuary working in longevity, where we might want to apply stresses for the various drivers of mortality to a select subgroup of the population.\nBefore the AI overlords take over, and the only cause of mortality is simply “death by robot”, I wanted to see if LLMs could help with this classification problem."

    "text": "The Premise\nFor this experiment I will get different LLMs to classify the ICD-10 causes of death into broader categories. The categories I have pulled from a paper online related to the cause-specific mortality impact of smoking. The paper and categories are not too important, they are just an example of what an actuary might be use. The following paper…\nCigarette Smoking Cessation, Total and Cause-specific Mortality: A 22-Year Follow-up Study in US Male Physicians\n…states that smoking showed an increase in mortality for the following categories of disease:\n\ncoronary heart disease\ncerebrovascular disease\npulmonary disease\nlung cancer\ncolorectal cancer\nlarynx cancer\nkidney cancer\nacute myeloid leukemia\noral cavity cancer\nesophageal cancer\npancreatic cancer\nbladder cancer\nstomach cancer\nprostate cancer\nsudden death\n\nThis paper would be very useful, but my other dataset is the ONS cause of death mortality by ICD-10 code in England and Wales. A snapshot of just some of those causes of death is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Random Sample of Causes of Death\n  \n    \n      Cause of Death\n      No of Deaths 2013 to 2023\n    \n  \n  \n    Cushing syndrome unspecified\n42\n    Benign neoplasm Appendix\n2\n    Other specified diseases of biliary tract\n34\n    Sarcoidosis of lung\n602\n    Primary pulmonary hypertension\n570\n    Malignant neoplasm Glans penis\n17\n    Other instability of joint\n1\n    Malignant neoplasm External upper lip\n10\n    Somatoform autonomic dysfunction\n2\n    Occupant [any] of heavy transport vehicle injured in other specified transport accidents\n1\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThere are thousands listed. Each category in our smoking paper can cover many causes of death in the data set. Can an LLM figure which ones out so an actuary won’t have to?"

    "title": "Artificial Actuary: Classifying Causes of Death",
    "section": "Method",
    "text": "Method\nMy initial attempt at this tried to use the {mall} package and an LLM that I downloaded straight to my computer. It became apparent quite soon that the processing power of LLMs is enormous, and too much for my humble laptop.\nInstead, I have used the brilliant {ellmer} package. This package allows R users to connect to a whole range of APIs available. Spoilt for choice, I set up a few links. The following LLMs were used:\n\nChat GPT 4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06)\nChat GPT 4o Mini (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18)\nGemini (gemini-2.0-flash-001)\nLlama (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)\nDeepseek R1, distilled (deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b)\n\nInitial attempts revealed some of the problems with using LLMs to clean data.\nThe first issue was around token limits and speed. Sending a single cause of death at a time would be unlikely to trigger the limits of the API and has the benefit of data structure being more regular (see second issue). However it would take far too long, and would be inefficient with token use asking the same question for each single cause of death. On the opposite end of the spectrum, sending data in larger chunks can sometimes cause failure as token limits are reached for a request. They also create data structure problem as the LLM is now giving us multiple data points in one chat we must decode this and hope they haven’t gone off-the-wall. In the end the best solution was to chunk the data and send over in batches.\nThe second main issue was getting data back in a regular format. It was almost comical how badly behave some of the LLMs were at being regular. Sometimes the no. of results didn’t match the no. of items sent. It was also impossible to get Deepseek to stop explaining itself in the output - no matter what I told it in the prompt! In the end it became apparent the best strategy was to communicate in JSON format and get the key results wrapped up in markers so I can extract it from the text and convert back to a dataframe using jsonlite::fromJSON(). The initial prompt evolved over time. Below is what I sent in relation to structure:\n\n“You are a classification LLM. You will receive a JSON file. The file will contain a list of items with cause_of_death. It is important that you return only an edited version of the JSON file. Add ‘category’ to each item, which can only ever pick one of the values below. No explanations. Return only the data in a structured JSON format. Your final JSON code must begin with ``` and end with ```”\n\nThe final issue was ambiguity. Some of the categories in the smoking paper could be interpreted in different ways. For example “pulmonary disease” technically means any disease of the lungs, yet this could entail something completely disconnected to smoking, such as tuberculosis with HIV or asbestos poisoning. Genetic disorders are also not going to be relevant to our risk driver in this case. In the end, I added further instruction to my LLM prompt:\n\n“If a cause of death cannot be linked to smoking in any way, for example if it is an infectious disease, a genetic disorder, or has an external cause provided in the cause_of_death text (e.g. asbestos), then assign the category as”none””\n\nThis didn’t eliminate some ambiguity over some of the groups. In particular, the terms “sudden death” and “coronary heart disease” weren’t clear to me what they entailed precisely. Given I was hoping to mark the results, I dropped “sudden death” and changed to “ischaemic heart disease” respectively.\nFinally, before I fed the causes of death into the LLM, I shuffled them. My original dataset was already ordered in a way that hinted at its groups. This was very handy for me when I had an attempt at categorising, but why should I give the robots the same privilege? By shuffling we prevent them getting wise to patterns, and demonstrate extra capability of the artificial actuary over the human actuary."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nThere were 3,598 causes of death. I processed the category returned by each model, and compared to my own evaluation. A huge caveat here is that I am not a medical doctor, and have done the best with my very limited faculties. In general I have used the broader categorisation of ICD-10 codes that already exists.\nThe accuracy of every model was at least 93%. However because 3,353 of the causes of death fed in should not have been assigned a category, a score of 93% would also be attained by simply stating “none” for everything.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Accuracy and Completion Rates of LLMs\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Model\n      Accuracy\n      Proportion Answered\n    \n  \n  \n    unanimous_consensus\n99.6%\n88%\n    consensus\n97.6%\n100%\n    gpt_4o\n97.0%\n100%\n    deepseek_r1\n96.8%\n99%\n    gpt_4o_mini\n96.3%\n100%\n    gemini\n95.4%\n100%\n    llama_33\n93.3%\n100%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nTo get a better understanding of the model success, we look at the stats of precision, recall and f1. A higher precision score means the model was often right when assigning a category (other than “none”). A higher recall score means the model did not often assign a category incorrectly (other than “none”). The F1 score combines these two to give an overall performance rating.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Performance Evaluation of LLMs\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Model\n      \n        Count\n      \n      \n        Scores\n      \n    \n    \n      True Negative\n      False Negative\n      True Positive\n      False Positive\n      Precision\n      Recall\n      F1\n    \n  \n  \n    gpt_4o\n3282\n36\n190\n71\n73%\n84%\n78%\n    deepseek_r1\n3268\n53\n172\n62\n74%\n76%\n75%\n    gemini\n3219\n29\n197\n134\n60%\n87%\n71%\n    gpt_4o_mini\n3323\n103\n123\n29\n81%\n54%\n65%\n    llama_33\n3129\n18\n208\n222\n48%\n92%\n63%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can see that gpt_4o_mini is more reserved than the other models - only assigning a category to 132 causes of death. This results in the highest precision score, but a punishing recall score which leads it ranked near the bottom. Some of the mistakes made by gpt_4o_mini highlighted this over-cautiousness. For example the gpt_4o_mini model failed to class “intracerebral haemorrhage in brain stem” as a “cerebrovascular disease” which is probably one of the less ambiguous cases, and instead class it as “none”. There are many similar examples in the results data.\nWe can see that llama_33 had the opposite problem, assigning a category to 430 causes of death. This led to a great recall but poor precision, which ranked it last. Having looked through the individual results, it is clear to me that llama deserved its place at the bottom. It often assigned “{body part} cancer” to any disease with a corresponding body part. This led to many false positives which were fairly obvious. An example would be assigning “alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis” to “pancreatic cancer” which is clearly not appropriate given the prompt it was provided.\nGemini was also quite gung-ho, though faired better than llama.\nThe clear winners were gpt_4o and deepseek_r1. Looking through the differences, they were due to more ambiguous cases rather than clear error."

    "text": "Meta Results\nThe F1 scores attained were good, but not incredible. We are certainly not ready to hand the steering wheel over to our artificial friends just yet. But can we use the wisdom of crowds to boost our results further? I created two meta-models.\n“consensus” picks the most common category of the 5 models above\n“unanimous_consensus” picks the category that all 5 models agreed on, if they did not all agree it refrains from answering\nThe results are impressive, with “consensus” having strong scores, and “unanimous_consensus” having fantastic results. In all unanimous cases of differences, it was for the most ambiguous of categories, and I was no more sure of my own answer than the models. I could certainly have been persuaded that “unanimous_consensus” was the correct answer each time.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Performance Evaluation of Meta LLMs\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Model\n      \n        Count\n      \n      \n        Scores\n      \n    \n    \n      True Negative\n      False Negative\n      True Positive\n      False Positive\n      Precision\n      Recall\n      F1\n    \n  \n  \n    unanimous_consensus\n3016\n10\n106\n3\n97%\n91%\n94%\n    consensus\n3303\n35\n191\n50\n79%\n85%\n82%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nAlthough the pickiness of “unanimous_consensus” helped boost its scores, it came at a cost. This meta-model failed to provide a category for 444 causes of death, which was 12% of the data fed in. One could still say that 88% of our data was categorised with high accuracy is a great win, and the actuary now only has to deal with 444 cases instead of the overwhelming 3,500+.\nThe “consensus” meta-model actually returned an answer for every cause of death. There was never a split decision between the LLMs. This strategy would be a good way to go if we were adamant we didn’t want to review any of the data ourselves!\n\nConclusion\nAlthough many actuaries now ask questions of AI to help with their day-to-day work, using R it is possible to go further and integrate the AI into actuarial data processing and even models. I have provided just one use case here, but there are many more out there for the typical actuary.\nUsing one LLM is helpful. Using many is very helpful. We are not at a point where the artificial actuary can replace the human one yet. The LLMs cannot understand the broader context of the problem, and this was clear to me each time I had to alter the prompt to get things working.\nThis demonstration not only highlights the usefulness of AI, but the enhanced possibilities when working with the more modern actuarial coding languages like R and Python.\nIf you are interested in the complete results, they are collected in the interactive table below:"
